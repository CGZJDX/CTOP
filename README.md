# A Heuristic Algorithm for the Capacitated Team Orienteering Problem (CTOP)

**Item Problem:** maximize total profit from serving customers with demand and profit values using identical vehicles without exceeding capacity and a route length limit. 

**Item Method:** iterative insertion of the highest priority unvisited customer, feasibility maintenance via local search and removing customers with minimum total valuation, and diversification by switching priority rules. 

**Item Priority Rules:** (1) default sorting by valuation; (2) optional FIFO.
